Alx-system_engineering-devops(0x09-Web infrastructure design)


Definitions and Explanations.

1. For every additional element, why are adding it? 
I have added one server and one load balancer. Adding the new server has allowed me to 
separate each component (web server: Nginx, Application server: code base and Database: 
MySQL) in there own server and yet having one extra server with all the components to serve 
as a backup if any of the components or server fails. Each server is being monitored and has 
a firewall. I have also added an extra load balancer that will assist in handling more 
traffic across the whole infrastructure.
